This application/site was created as a submission to a [hybr1d.io](https://www.hybr1d.io/) challenge. The challenge was to build an application to show search results with the help of api.

## Usage

- First comes the home/main page where you can just put your query as search input and the hit the search button.
- Then it fetch the results from the api for that particular query and shows you result.
- Also there is small section of recent searches where recent search query result comes in button, hit one button and it fetch results for the query again.
- Each result has it's own id link where it takes you to different route and show's you additional information for that particular result.
- To get back to home/main page click the title in navbar.
